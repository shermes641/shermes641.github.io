The base code conventions for programming in Python are [here]( http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

Our exceptions to this are:

* Spaces around operators should not be modified in an attempt to reflect precedence.
*

Additions to this are:

* Variable naming conventions, adjective/noun/verb/etc. stuff....
